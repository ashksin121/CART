# Coherent Analysis of Romberg Test (CART)

A small and smart medical solution that tracks inner ear balance, and spinal posture without costly medical visits. The device performs medical tests like posturography, which checks the body's posture, the mean movement from the body axis, etc. The best part of the device is that it is small, compact, and autonomous i.e., a person can be tested in any particular environment around the clock.

## Components

* Android app - For collecting data from the patient, using pre-installed sensors
* Web platform - For displaying the results of the patient
